Update sources.list with the following:
deb http://archive.debian.org/debian/ squeeze main non-free contrib
deb-src http://archive.debian.org/debian/ squeeze main non-free contrib

deb http://archive.debian.org/debian-security/ squeeze/updates main non-free contrib
deb-src http://archive.debian.org/debian-security/ squeeze/updates main non-free contrib
Have to update in order for Debian
Run apt-get update
If a key error occurs: run apt-get install debian-archive-keyring, then rerun apt-get update
Run apt-get dist-upgrade
Reboot

Upgrade from Squeeze to Wheezy:
Run an apt-get update and upgrade before doing this
Edit your sources.list file and add the following sources to it:
deb http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian wheezy main contrib non-free
deb-src http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian wheezy main contrib non-free
deb http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian wheezy-updates main contrib non-free
deb http://security.debian.org/ wheezy/updates main contrib non-free

May have to use aptitude instead of apt at first.

SECURE SSH
Edit /etc/sshd_config:
Make sure Protocol 2 is used instead of Protocol 1
Change Port 22 to something different
Verify the file with /usr/sbin/sshd -t before reloading
service ssh restart

Install Fail2Ban
apt-get install Fail2Ban
cd /etc/fail2ban/
Copy the jail.conf file to jail.local using this command:
awk '{ printf "# "; print; }' /etc/fail2ban/jail.conf | sudo tee /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
This will comment out the contents of the file. Edit jail.local instead of jail.conf (except for Dovecot).
Secure SSH with Fail2Ban
Edit jail.local
Increase the bantime to some arbitrary large number
Change the ssh port to the port you chose earlier
Change maxretry to 0
Stop and restart fail2ban: service fail2ban stop, service fail2ban start
Check iptables rules using iptables -S

Secure Dovecot with Fail2Ban
Create the filter file /etc/fail2ban/filter.d/dovecot-pop3imap.conf
[Definition]
failregex = (?: pop3-login|imap-login): (?:Authentication failure|Aborted login \(auth failed|Aborted login \(tried to use disabled|Disconnected \(auth failed).*rip=(?P<host>\S*),.*
ignoreregex =

Add the following to /etc/fail2ban/jail.conf:
[dovecot-pop3imap]
enabled = true
filter = dovecot-pop3imap
action = iptables-multiport[name=dovecot-pop3imap, port="pop3,imap", protocol=tcp]
logpath = /var/log/maillog
maxretry = 20
findtime = 1200
bantime = 1200

Enable various jails for installed applications as well.

INSTALL UFW
apt-get install ufw
Figure out which ports need to be denied and allowed

FIND IMMUTABLE FILES
lsattr -R / 2>/dev/null | grep -- "-i-"
chattr -V +i file = make file immutable
chattr -V -i file = make file mutable
Consider making /etc/passwd immutable so new users can't be added

INSTALL SCREEN
`apt-get install screen`
Use `screen -S <name>` to make a new screen, run something that will take a while, then do `ctrl+a, d` to detach from the screen.
To go back to the screen do `screen -r <name>`

USE OPENSSL TO CREATE AN SSL certificate
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365
Secure the folder containing the certificates with chmod 0750
Secure the key with chmod 0640
Secure the certificate with chmod 0644
Change dovecot configuration to use the key and cert:
The file is an SSL file in /etc/dovecot/conf.d
ssl_cert = </etc/letsencrypt/live/mail.example.com/fullchain.pem
ssl_key = </etc/letsencrypt/live/mail.example.com/privkey.pem
Edit exim's config file: /etc/exim.conf
tls_certificate = /etc/exim.cert
tls_privatekey = /etc/exim.key
Edit postfix's config file:

RESTRICT DEVELOPER TOOLS
Create a group called compiler: groupadd compiler
Change the owner of /usr/bin/gcc and other development tools: chown root:compiler /usr/bin/gcc
Change the permissions on gcc and other tools using chmod 0750 /usr/bin/gcc

IPTABLES
Drop packets sent from an IP: sudo iptables -A INPUT -s IP_ADDRESS -j DROP
Unblock IP: sudo iptables -D INPUT -s IP_ADDRESS -j DROP

FIND PORTS THAT YOUR APPLICATIONS ARE USING(Figure out which command works):
sudo lsof -i
sudo netstat -lptu
sudo netstat -tulpn

Maybe install locate?
apt-get install locate
updatedb (updates locates database)
